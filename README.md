# ML-Linear-Models-for-Binary-Classification


 Below are the models expected to implement.

1. Fisher’s linear discriminant- as described in Bishop ch 4.
	Further to find y0 (threshold) use minimum entropy criterion.
	Refer Tom Mitchell, Machine Learning ch 3 for a detailed description of entropy.

2. Probabilistic Generative Model-as described in Bishop ch 4
	• assume the class-conditioned densities p(x|Ck ) are Gaussian with both classes sharing the same covariance matrix
	• assume the posterior probabilities is given by a sigmoid function

3. Logistic Regression (Probabilistic Discriminative Model)-as described in Bishop ch 4.
	• Use gradient descent algorithm.(without using any package)
	• Experiment with different learning rates.
